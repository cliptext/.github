## About Us

At **Cliptext**, we believe in the power of collaboration and creativity. Our platform enables users to create, manage, and share clips effortlessly, whether they are educational videos, tutorials, or entertaining snippets. With a focus on user experience and efficiency, we leverage modern technologies to deliver a robust and intuitive interface.

## Microservices Architecture

Our application is built using a microservices architecture, which allows us to decompose our platform into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This architecture offers several advantages:

- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on demand.
- **Flexibility**: We can use different technologies for different services.
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service does not affect the entire application.
- **Faster Development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously.

### Services Overview

The following core services power the Cliptext platform:

1. **Authentication Service**: Manages user registration, login, and authentication via Keycloak.
2. **Clip Management Service**: Responsible for creating, updating, and deleting clips, ensuring that users can manage their content effectively.
3. **User Profile Service**: Handles user profiles, including settings and preferences.
4. **Payment Service**: Integrates with Yookassa for processing payments and subscriptions.
5. **Caching Service**: Implements caching strategies using DragonflyDB to enhance performance and reduce latency.
